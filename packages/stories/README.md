# SuperEffective's Story Board

## What is this?

This is a collection of [StoryLite](https://itsjavi.com/storylite) stories that we have written to
help us document, showcase and test (in styles isolation) the different features of our website,
[supereffective.gg](https://supereffective.gg).

Here we can view the components in different sizes, in dark mode, different variants, etc. to see if
there are any visual bugs or inconsistencies.

The grid also help us see how the components are aligned to each other and how they behave when the
screen size changes.

You can find the different components in the left sidebar (or at the top if you are on mobile).
